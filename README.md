Headphones for the modern age

Currently, the world is going through the shift of moving from the 3.5 mm headphone jack to the new current USB standard connector USB-C.
More can be done on this aspect to make it more attractive to switch over to the new standard but in a way that doesn't compromise.

First and foremost, what are the main components of a pair of headphones. I've taken a small sample set of broken headphones from different brands and styles to see what makes them tick:



From here I analyzed and noticed a few things:

#### Current issues:

1. These kind of headphones damaged easily, mainly internal wire damage that prevented any sort of descrete repair. If you wanted to fix them you would have to cut them apart and do some kind of solder and glue together job.

2. The audio quality of some of these headphones weren't all that great. It's very difficuilt to design a pair of headphones that are cheap and sound good.

3. Dongles, Dongles, Dongles. One pair of headphones comes with one kind of connector, to have it work with another kind of device, you would need to have an adapter and remember to carry it around, they are very small so it is easy to lose

4. Everyone has different kind of ears, its hard to make a one size fit all pair of headphone that stay in your ear and that are comfortable. Some manufacturers have decided to either make ear-hooks and ear-tips or just a single uniform design.

5. Bluetooth and wireless headphones are great, but they require charging a battery and cumbersome charging methods.

#### Anatomy:

Headphones come with very few components, of course there is a pair of small speakers and wires and a jack, some headphones come with volume buttons a middle switch for phone and music control and a built in microphone. more advanced headphones come with a built in DAC (Digital to Audio Converter) for converting the bits to actual audio, audio quality is dependent of this factor.
